# Variables in Java

## Introduction
Variables are essential in Java for storing and manipulating data. Java has a strong typing system, requiring each variable to be declared with a specific data type. This lab explores various data types in Java, including their size and range.

## VariablesLab.java
The `VariablesLab.java` program demonstrates the declaration, initialization, and output of variables of different data types:

### Integer Types
- `byte`: 8-bit, range from -128 to 127
- `short`: 16-bit, range from -32,768 to 32,767
- `int`: 32-bit, range from -2^31 to 2^31-1
- `long`: 64-bit, range from -2^63 to 2^63-1

### Floating-Point Types
- `float`: 32-bit, approximately ±3.4E±38 with 7 decimal places
- `double`: 64-bit, approximately ±1.8E±308 with 15 decimal places

### Other Types
- `char`: 16-bit, represents Unicode characters
- `boolean`: Represents true or false values
- `String`: A sequence of characters

### How to Run
```bash
javac VariablesLab.java
java VariablesLab
